# sandbox

Hello GitHub!
My sandbox is a place for me to jot my concepts and brainstorm through my coursework. 

I am a computer science student in Eugene, Oregon, USA. Though I intend to go into systems analysis, I am interested in gaming and recreational software as well.

I hope that I can both learn from and contribute to this community in order to gain more insight than my formal education alone can offer.  

Currently I am learning C++, but have some exposure to Javascript.
